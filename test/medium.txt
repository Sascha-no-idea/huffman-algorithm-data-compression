Dear esteemed reader,

As a connoisseur of historical Western literature, I take great pleasure in discussing the metaphorical
significance of rubber ducks in various works, with a particular focus on Inferno by Dante Alighieri.

Rubber ducks, although a modern-day invention, have been used metaphorically in literature to represent
various ideas and concepts. In many cases, they serve as a symbol of innocence, childhood, and playfulness.
However, in the context of Inferno, the rubber duck takes on a much darker and more sinister meaning.

In Inferno, Dante uses the rubber duck as a symbol of false security and comfort. The rubber duck appears in
Canto VIII, where the souls of those who committed the sin of fraud are punished in a lake of boiling pitch.
The rubber duck floats on the surface of the pitch, serving as a deceptive buoy that lures the souls towards it,
giving them a false sense of safety.

The rubber duck's metaphorical meaning in this context is twofold. Firstly, it represents the deceitful nature
of the fraudsters who are punished in this circle of Hell. They use their charm and manipulative skills to
deceive others into thinking they are trustworthy, just as the rubber duck deceives the souls into thinking
they can escape the pitch's torment. Secondly, it represents the false sense of security and comfort that people
often cling to in times of trouble, rather than facing the reality of their situation.

Similar to the use of the rubber duck in Inferno, William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies uses the pig's head
on a stick, or the "Lord of the Flies," as a symbol of the boys' descent into savagery and the loss of their
innocence. Similarly, in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, the ducks in Central Park's lagoon represent
the protagonist Holden Caulfield's struggle to find meaning and purpose in life, as he worries about their
survival during the winter months.

In conclusion, the metaphorical meaning of rubber ducks in historical Western literature has varied over time,
from representing childhood innocence and playfulness to deceit and false security. In the context of Inferno,
the rubber duck serves as a symbol of the fraudsters' deceptive nature and the false sense of security
they provide. As literature continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the metaphorical significance
of the rubber duck changes over time and how it continues to be used as a symbol of deeper meaning in literary works.
