My dear reader,

allow me to regale you with the intricacies of the metaphorical meaning of rubber ducks in historical Western
literature. The rubber duck, a seemingly innocuous object, has been used as a symbol in various literary works
throughout history. In this essay, we will explore the significance of rubber ducks in two well-known works of
literature, namely Dante Alighieri's Inferno and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, and also examine its use
in artwork.

Let us begin with Dante's Inferno, the first part of his epic poem, The Divine Comedy. In Inferno, Dante explores
the nine circles of Hell, each reserved for a different sin. In Canto XXI, Dante describes the punishment for
barrators (corrupt politicians) in the fifth circle of Hell. They are submerged in a boiling lake of pitch,
and demons known as the Malebranche (evil claws) use hooks to drag them down when they try to escape. As Dante
and his guide, Virgil, approach the boiling lake, they notice what appears to be a group of black ducks swimming
in the pitch. Upon closer inspection, however, they realize that these are not ducks but rather the souls of
the barrators, transformed into hideous, bird-like creatures. These creatures are constantly being plunged into
the boiling pitch by the Malebranche, who are compared to "a cook who watches his basting meat."

The metaphorical meaning of the rubber duck in this context is that of deception. Just as the barrators were
corrupt in their earthly lives, so too are the black ducks a deceptive facade, masking the true nature of the
sinners in Hell. Additionally, the transformation of the barrators into bird-like creatures suggests that their
sins have stripped them of their humanity, reducing them to mere animals. The ducks also serve as a contrast to
the purity and innocence of real ducks, which are often associated with calm and peaceful waters. By using the
rubber duck as a symbol in Inferno, Dante highlights the theme of deception and the consequences of
corrupt behavior.

Moving on to Goethe's Faust, we find another interesting use of the rubber duck as a symbol. In the second part
of the play, Faust seeks enlightenment and knowledge, and his quest takes him to the court of the emperor, where
he becomes embroiled in the politics of the day. At one point, Faust presents the emperor with a new
invention - a rubber duck. The emperor is thrilled with the novelty of the toy, and orders his courtiers to chase
after it, thus distracting them from their work. However, the duck soon pops, and the emperor is left feeling
disappointed and unsatisfied.

The metaphorical meaning of the rubber duck in Faust is that of superficiality and distraction. The emperor and
his courtiers are so easily swayed by the novelty of the toy that they neglect their duties and responsibilities.
The popping of the duck represents the fleeting nature of pleasure and the disappointment that often follows
when we chase after superficial things. Goethe uses the rubber duck to criticize the superficiality of the
aristocracy and their lack of concern for the important issues of the day.

Finally, let us examine the use of the rubber duck in artwork. One example of this is Jeff Koons' sculpture,
Rabbit, which features a large, inflatable rubber duck placed on top of a stainless steel rabbit. The sculpture
was created in 1986 and is part of Koons' series, Banality. The rubber duck in this context represents childhood
innocence and playfulness, while the rabbit represents adulthood and responsibility. By placing the duck on top
of the rabbit, Koons is suggesting that the two are not mutually exclusive, and that we should strive to retain
a sense of childlike wonder and joy throughout our lives.

In conclusion, theIn conclusion, the metaphorical meaning of rubber ducks in historical Western literature is
complex and multifaceted. In Dante's Inferno, the rubber duck represents deception and the consequences of corrupt
behavior. In Goethe's Faust, it symbolizes superficiality and distraction. In artwork, such as Jeff Koons' Rabbit,
it represents the importance of maintaining a sense of childlike wonder throughout our lives. The use of the
rubber duck as a symbol highlights important themes in literature and art, and encourages us to reflect on our
own values and priorities.

It is worth noting that the use of the rubber duck as a symbol in literature and art is not limited to Western
culture. In Japan, for example, the rubber duck has become a popular symbol of resilience and hope in the wake
of natural disasters. In 2011, following the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a giant rubber duck
created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman was placed in the harbor of Onomichi as a symbol of hope and renewal.

In summary, the metaphorical meaning of rubber ducks in historical Western literature is a fascinating topic that
highlights the richness and complexity of symbolism in literature and art. The rubber duck can represent deception,
superficiality, childhood innocence, resilience, and hope, depending on the context in which it is used. As we
continue to explore the symbolism of everyday objects, we gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and
the human condition.
